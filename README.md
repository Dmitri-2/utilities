# Utilities

This repository contains some utilities, which we hope 
will prove useful to Grace programmers.  We expect more utilities to
be added over time.

 - gracefmt:  re-indents a Grace program in the approved style

 - gracedoc:  creates documentation for a grace module, based on the comments in the source.
